# Reporting Survival Probabilities: Kaplan-Meier Curves and Cox Model for Burn and Transplant Datasets

ACST3058 Actuarial Modelling Assignment 1 (2023)

This assignment focused on reproducible reporting of survival probabilities using Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards model on burn and bone marrow transplant data. Emphasized clear visualization and structured documentation.

## Key Tasks
- Estimated survival probabilities with Kaplan-Meier curves  
- Fitted Cox PH model to explore covariate effects  
- Reported survival trends and hazard ratios  

## Skills Demonstrated
- R programming for survival analysis and reporting  
- Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox model fitting  
- Reproducible plotting and documentation of results  

## Submission Details
- The attached PDF is the rendered output from an original R Markdown (.Rmd) document.  
  (Original .Rmd source file is no longer available, but the PDF preserves all survival curves, model summaries, plots, and explanations.)
